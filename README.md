# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

In the course project for Getting and Cleaning Data, we were to create an R script, run_analysis.R, which does the following:

1. Download and unzip the file that is the messy data we are supposed to tidy up. 
2. Load features and activity data
3. Loads training and test datasets and finds and keeps only mean and standard deviation columns in both datasets 
4. Loads subject and activity data for both datasets + merges this data with dataset  
5. Merges the 2 datasets 
6. Converts the columns of activity and subject to factors 
7. Creates a new tidy dataset which has the mean values for all variables for each subject and activity combination (this dataset is seen in tidy.txt)
